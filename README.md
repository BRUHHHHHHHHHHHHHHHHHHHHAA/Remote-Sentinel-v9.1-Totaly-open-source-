# 🛰️ Remote Sentinel

**Remote Sentinel v9.0 - Improved FDS** is one of the most advanced RemoteEvent/Function inspection, fuzzing, and injection tools ever created for Roblox. Designed with offensive security and deep analysis in mind, it offers a modern graphical interface, heuristic analysis, adaptive fuzzing, and multiple scanners for real-world vulnerabilities.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🔧 **Required** Executor: **87% to 100% UNC** compatibility
- ✅ **Tested and validated ONLY with [Ronix](https://ronix.wtf/)**
- Required features:
- `getconnections`, `hookfunction`, `debug.getupvalue`, `getnilinstances`
- Full support for `CoreGui`, `setclipboard`, `loadstring`, `HttpService.RequestAsync`

---

## 🧠 Main Features

- 🔍 **Deep Scan**: Detects all `RemoteEvents`, `RemoteFunctions`, `BindableEvents`, and `BindableFunctions`, including hidden ones and those in unusual services
- 🎛️ **Modern GUI interface**: central window with tabs, filters, history, status, and custom theme
- ⚠️ **Vulnerability Detector**:
- Scanners for backdoors, insecure patterns, anti-cheats, external requires, and open permissions
- Static analysis of client-side scripts (understanding dangerous logic)
- 💥 **Advanced Fuzzing**:
- Ready-made profiles: destructive commands, stat manipulation, exploits with metatables, memory, crashes, etc.
- Support for heuristic and adaptive fuzzing
- Customizable fuzz with direct code (`loadstring`)
- 🧪 **Payload Injector**: command execution system with visible function return (`InvokeServer`), response analysis, and alerts
- 📡 **HTTP Request Sender**: useful for testing exploits in external backdoors (such as WebPanel, Adonis HTTP, etc.)
- 🧾 **Recorder & Replay**: records all calls fired and allows automatic replay.
- 📈 **Analyzer**: interprets logic based on the responses returned from fuzzing (`success`, `kicked`, `admin`, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Ideal for:

- Developers who want to test their games against remote abuse
- Ethical exploitation and internal auditing (white-hat)
- Fuzzing testing with real-time feedback
- Reverse engineering of remote scripts (using `Spy`, `Analyzer`, `Recorder`)
